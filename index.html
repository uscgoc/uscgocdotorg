        <p class="lead">Grace On Campus is a ministry of Grace Community Church which ministers to college-age individuals in the USC area. We meet each Friday night on campus at the University of Southern California to worship God through singing, studying the Bible and fellowshipping with one another.

Throughout the week there are various formal and informal meetings to facilitate deeper relationships and discipleship among our students. One of the primary ways that discipleship takes place in GOC is through our small groups which meet weekly for Bible study, accountability, encouragement and prayer.

					<strong>Parking</strong></br>
					
					There is street parking on Hoover, just north of Jefferson. It is $1/hour, and it's free after 8pm. The meters accept coins and credit card.</br>
						You can also park on campus in Parking Structure X for $8/day, which is accessible from Gate #3 (USC McCarthy Way and Figueroa Street).</br>
						You can try to find free street parking around Orchard Ave. and W 30th Street or McClintock Ave. However, it is often difficult to find a parking spot on these streets.

	        We carpool to Grace Community Church together on Sundays. If you would like a ride, email <a href="mailto:uscgocrides@gmail.com">uscgocrides@gmail.com</a> before Saturday morning at 10am. Please put your name, phone number, and pickup address in the email and your driver will be in touch with you by Saturday night.</br></br>
	        
	        <strong>Here's the process:</strong></br>
	        Make sure to specify whether you want to be a rider or driver when you sign up.</br></br>
	     
If you're a driver, we'll let you know who you'll be driving by Saturday afternoon (ish). Please text or call your riders to let them know when to expect you Sunday morning.</br></br>

If you're a rider, keep an eye out for that text message on Saturday night from your driver. Church starts at 8:30am so your ride will most likely leave around 7:45am to get there in time.
